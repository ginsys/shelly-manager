# Claude Code Development Context

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Status
This Shelly Device Manager was developed through a comprehensive conversation with Claude. The project includes:

âœ… **Complete Foundation**: Working Go application with CLI, API, and web interface
âœ… **Architecture Designed**: Full system architecture for device management
âœ… **Framework Ready**: Structured for advanced features implementation
âœ… **Documentation**: Complete context and requirements captured

## ðŸ”§ Current Implementation
- **Main Application**: Single file with all core functionality
- **Mock Data**: Demonstration of all features with simulated devices
- **Web Interface**: Modern responsive UI with full feature parity
- **Configuration**: Complete YAML-based configuration system
- **Database**: SQLite with GORM for device persistence
- **Docker Support**: Container deployment ready

## ðŸš€ Immediate Development Priorities

### 1. Code Organization
- [ ] Split monolithic `main.go` into proper packages
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and logging
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
- [ ] Set up proper Go project structure

### 2. Real Implementation
- [ ] Replace mock discovery with actual Shelly API calls
- [ ] Implement WiFi provisioning system
- [ ] Add DHCP reservation management
- [ ] Complete OPNSense integration

### 3. Production Readiness
- [ ] Add monitoring and health checks
- [ ] Implement backup/restore functionality
- [ ] Add device group management
- [ ] Optimize for large-scale deployments

## ðŸ“š Key Context Files
- `docs/development-context.md` - Complete conversation history
- `configs/shelly-manager.yaml` - Full configuration example
- `README.md` - Project overview and usage

## ðŸ§ª Testing Requirements
- Mock Shelly device responses for testing
- Network interface testing without real WiFi hardware
- Database migration and schema testing
- API endpoint validation
- Container deployment testing

## ðŸ’¡ Architecture Insights
- **Device Lifecycle**: Discovery â†’ Provisioning â†’ DHCP â†’ Management
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Linux, macOS, Windows compatibility required
- **Container Deployment**: Privileged mode needed for WiFi operations
- **API Design**: RESTful with full CRUD operations
- **Configuration Management**: Environment variables + YAML files

## ðŸ”— Integration Points
- **Shelly Devices**: HTTP API on port 80, standard endpoints
- **OPNSense**: REST API for DHCP reservation management
- **Network Stack**: Platform-specific WiFi control (nmcli, networksetup, netsh)
- **Database**: SQLite for local storage, easily replaceable
