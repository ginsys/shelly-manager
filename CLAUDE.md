### ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Phase 4.1: Configuration System Bug Fix (v0.4.1-alpha)

**Achievement**: Successfully resolved YAML configuration parsing error and enhanced error reporting.

**Issue Resolution**:
- ‚úÖ **Root Cause**: Go telemetry binary files with control characters were being picked up by viper's config search paths, causing "yaml: control characters are not allowed" error
- ‚úÖ **Solution**: Enhanced viper search path configuration in `internal/config/config.go` to avoid binary files
- ‚úÖ **Error Reporting**: Added detailed error messages showing exact config file paths being loaded
- ‚úÖ **Testing**: Verified server startup works correctly with default config search (`go run ./cmd/shelly-manager server`)

**Technical Fix Details**:
- Reorganized viper.AddConfigPath() order to prioritize `./configs` directory
- Enhanced error messages to include exact file paths during config loading failures
- Added configFilePath reporting using viper.ConfigFileUsed() for better debugging
- Server now starts successfully without explicit --config flag
