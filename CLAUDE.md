```

#### Dependencies
- **CLI Framework**: spf13/cobra v1.8.0
- **Configuration**: spf13/viper v1.18.2
- **HTTP Router**: gorilla/mux v1.8.0
- **Database ORM**: gorm.io/gorm v1.25.5 with SQLite driver
- **Database**: SQLite (requires CGO_ENABLED=1 for compilation)
- **Logging**: slog (Go 1.21+ standard library)

#### Web Interface
- **Location**: `web/static/index.html`
- **Technology**: Vanilla JavaScript (no framework)
- **Features**: Full device management UI
- **Styling**: Modern gradient design with responsive layout

#### Build & Deployment
- **Build System**: Makefile with common targets (build, run, test, docker-build)
- **Docker**: Multi-stage Dockerfile for minimal image size
- **Docker Compose**: Available for local development
- **Binary Output**: `bin/shelly-manager`

### Key Components

**Device Model**: Core entity with IP, MAC, type, name, firmware, status, and settings (JSON). Uses GORM with SQLite.

**Configuration System**: YAML-based config using Viper, supports nested structures for server, database, discovery, provisioning, DHCP, and OPNSense settings.

**API Endpoints**: RESTful API on port 8080:
- `/api/v1/devices` - CRUD operations
- `/api/v1/discover` - Trigger network discovery
- `/api/v1/provisioning/*` - WiFi provisioning operations
- `/api/v1/dhcp/*` - DHCP reservation management
- Static web UI served from `/web/static/`

**Logging System**: Structured logging with slog, context propagation, and configurable levels.

**WiFi Provisioning**: Platform-specific implementations for:
- Linux: NetworkManager/nmcli
- macOS: CoreWLAN/networksetup
- Windows: netsh/PowerShell

### Platform Considerations
WiFi provisioning requires platform-specific network interface control:
- Linux: NetworkManager/wpa_supplicant
- macOS: CoreWLAN framework
- Windows: Windows.Devices.WiFi API

## Important Context

This is a Shelly smart home device manager designed for:
1. Discovering Shelly devices on the network
2. Provisioning unconfigured devices via their AP mode
3. Managing DHCP reservations for stable IP assignments
4. Integration with OPNSense firewall

The application has been fully refactored with comprehensive architecture and real implementations. All major components have unit tests and integration tests.

## Development Notes

## Development Priorities (Updated 2025-08-10)

### User Requirements & Constraints
- **Primary Goal**: Fully working system with advanced features for managing ~20-100 Shelly devices
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes-first with container architecture
- **Architecture**: Dual-binary design (API server + provisioning agent)
- **Security**: Basic authentication sufficient (home project)
- **IPv6**: Code prepared but not required
- **Integrations**: Export functionality first, OPNSense second

### Implementation Roadmap

#### Phase 1: Core Shelly Device Management (PRIORITY 1)
**Goal**: Real device communication and management with type-safe configuration
- [ ] Shelly API client implementation (Gen1 & Gen2+)
- [ ] Device authentication handling
- [ ] Real-time status polling
- [ ] **NEW: Composition-based configuration management**
  - [ ] Implement capability-based configuration architecture
  - [ ] Replace json.RawMessage with type-safe configuration blocks
  - [ ] Import device configuration from physical devices to database
  - [ ] Update device configuration from database to physical devices
  - [ ] Verify/compare current device config against database stored config
  - [ ] Configuration drift detection and reporting
  - [ ] Bulk configuration sync operations
- [ ] Firmware version tracking
- [ ] Bulk device operations
- [ ] Error recovery and retry logic

##### NEW: Composition-Based Configuration Architecture
**Document**: `docs/DEVICE_CONFIGURATION_ARCHITECTURE.md`

The configuration system now uses a composition-based approach where devices combine multiple capability "mixins":

**Core Capabilities**:
- `RelayConfig` - Switch/relay control settings
- `PowerMeteringConfig` - Power monitoring and protection
- `DimmingConfig` - Brightness control for dimmers/lights
- `RollerConfig` - Roller shutter/motor control
- `InputConfig` - Button and input configuration
- `LEDConfig` - LED indicator settings
- `ColorConfig` - RGB/color control

**Device Examples**:
- `SHSW-1` = RelayConfig + InputConfig
- `SHSW-PM` = RelayConfig + PowerMeteringConfig + InputConfig + TempProtectionConfig  
- `SHSW-25` = Mode-specific (Relay1+Relay2 OR RollerConfig) + PowerMeteringConfig

**Template Benefits**:
- Target by capability: "All devices with power metering"
- Target by device type: "All SHPLG-S devices"
- Type-safe configuration with compile-time checking

- Redis caching layer
- Worker pool for discovery
- Connection pooling
- Batch API operations
- Event-driven updates
- Horizontal scaling with load balancer

## Original Requirements & Context

### Core Functionality
The user requested a Golang application for managing Shelly smart home devices with:
- **Headless operation** in containers
- **CLI interface** for all functionality
- **SQLite database** for persistence
- **Configuration file** support (YAML)
- **API server mode** for web frontend integration

### Key Features

#### Device Discovery & Management
- HTTP scanning of network ranges for Shelly devices
- mDNS/Bonjour discovery for advertised devices
- SSDP/UPnP discovery for modern devices
- Database persistence of device information
- Real-time status monitoring

#### WiFi Provisioning System
Handle unconfigured devices that expose their own WiFi SSID:
- Network interface control (requires host system access)
- WiFi AP scanning for Shelly device patterns
- Automated connection to device APs
- Device configuration via HTTP API
- Production WiFi setup and device reboot
- Platform-specific implementations (Linux, macOS, Windows)

#### DHCP Integration
Generate DHCP reservations for OPNSense firewall:
- MAC address extraction from provisioned devices
- Hostname standardization for network management
- IP pool management with automatic assignment
- OPNSense API integration for automated reservation creation
- Export capabilities (JSON, CSV, XML formats)

### Deployment Architecture

#### Container Requirements
- **Privileged mode** required for WiFi operations
- **Host network access** for network interface control
- **Volume mounts** for data persistence
- **Device access** (/dev/rfkill for WiFi)

### Complete Device Lifecycle
1. **Discovery**: Scan for unconfigured Shelly AP networks
2. **Provisioning**: Connect to AP, configure WiFi credentials
3. **Network Integration**: Device joins production network
4. **DHCP Reservation**: Extract MAC/hostname, create reservation
5. **Firewall Sync**: Push reservations to OPNSense
6. **Device Management**: Configure settings via main application
