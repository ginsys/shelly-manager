- Pagination: 10 devices default, dropdown for 20/30/50/100/All
- Search: All fields (name, IP, MAC, type, status, hostname, notes)
- Auto-refresh: Configurable intervals (1s/5s/10s/30s/off), default 30s
- Updates: Only existing devices, discovery remains separate manual process

**Device Management:**
- Core fields display: name, type, IP, MAC, model (firmware in detail view)
- Authentication status: filterable with üîê icon
- Device-specific UI profiles based on actual capabilities:
  - Single switch: one on/off/toggle
  - Dual switch: two separate controls
  - Dimmer: slider + on/off
  - Roller shutter: up/down/stop/position
  - Sensors: readings only, no controls
- Notes field implemented, extensible metadata design
- Modal confirmations (not browser alerts) for destructive operations
- Optimistic UI with timeout/fallback for control commands

**Configuration Management:**
- Import/export: Complete device configuration (EVERYTHING)
- Side-by-side diff UI for all config operations
- Full validation: schema, ranges, compatibility, network, dependencies, security

- Template inheritance support (simple implementation first)
- History tracking: configurable retention (count + time)
- View modes: full config + diff between any versions
- Device + template history/rollback (device-level priority)
- Automatic drift detection: every 4 hours (configurable)
- Any configuration change = drift
- Visual indicators + hook system for alerts
- Auto-sync option for GitOps mode

**WiFi Provisioning:**
- Separate UI page working with dedicated provisioning binary
- WiFi credentials: stored encrypted in database, not config file
- Multiple target networks supported (not fallbacks)
- No additional authentication required
- Retry logic: none for device config, 2-3 for WiFi connection issues
- Timeout: 30s default, configurable per session and in config file
- Missing device handling: mark as missing in API/UI

**DHCP Management:**
- IP assignment: auto-assign next available, allow manual override
- Single IP pool for all device types
- Hostname templates with variables: {type}, {id}, {name}, {mac-short}
- Conflict handling: report + propose fixes, user approves
- OPNSense sync: user validation required before any push
- Sync modes: manual + scheduled, both require validation
- Rollback support for failed syncs
- API credentials: encrypted in database, manual UI rotation

**System Features:**
- Comprehensive audit log for all operations
- Performance: start simple, prepare for batching at scale
- Error handling: graceful fallbacks, clear user feedback
- Security: data encryption preparation, extensible auth system

##### Remaining Web UI Validation Questions (High Priority)

**Performance & Scalability (Critical for 100+ devices):**
- Q47: Large list handling - at what device count should pagination/virtualization kick in?
- Q48: Caching strategy - cache duration for device status (none, 1s, 5s)?
- Q49: Offline mode - should UI work partially when API unavailable?
- Q50: Background operations - should long operations run in background with progress indication?

**Browser Compatibility (Deployment needs):**
- Q51: Legacy browser support - is IE11/Legacy Edge support needed?
- Q52: Design approach - desktop-first or mobile-first design approach?
- Q53: Touch gestures - support swipe actions on mobile devices?
- Q54: PWA capability - should it be installable as Progressive Web App?

**Security (Before production):**
- Q55: Authentication - will UI require login in future?
- Q56: Session management - how long should sessions remain active?
- Q57: Data encryption - should sensitive data be encrypted in local storage?
- Q58: Audit logging - track all user actions for security audit?

**UI/UX Priorities (User experience):**
- Q59: Feature prioritization - which features are blocking vs nice-to-have?
- Q60: Timeline - target completion date for each priority level?
- Q61: User feedback - how to collect and prioritize user feature requests?
- Q66: Dark mode - is dark theme a priority?
- Q67: Dashboard customization - should users customize dashboard layout?
- Q68: Notifications - in-app only or also email/push notifications?
- Q69: Accessibility - WCAG compliance level (A, AA, AAA)?

**Future Features (Lower priority):**
- Q62: Scheduling - what types of schedules (time-based, sunrise/sunset, conditions)?
- Q63: Automation - rule engine complexity (simple if-then vs complex logic)?
- Q64: Integrations - which third-party systems to integrate with first?
- Q65: Monitoring - what metrics are most important (power, uptime, response time)?

**Status: 46/69 questions answered and validated**

#### Build & Deployment
- **Build System**: Makefile with common targets (build, run, test, docker-build)
- **Docker**: Multi-stage Dockerfile for minimal image size
- **Docker Compose**: Available for local development
- **Binary Output**: `bin/shelly-manager`

### Key Components

**Device Model**: Core entity with IP, MAC, type, name, firmware, status, and settings (JSON). Uses GORM with SQLite.

**Configuration System**: YAML-based config using Viper, supports nested structures for server, database, discovery, provisioning, DHCP, and OPNSense settings.

**API Endpoints**: RESTful API on port 8080:
- `/api/v1/devices` - CRUD operations
- `/api/v1/discover` - Trigger network discovery
- `/api/v1/provisioning/*` - WiFi provisioning operations
- `/api/v1/dhcp/*` - DHCP reservation management
- Static web UI served from `/web/static/`

**Logging System**: Structured logging with slog, context propagation, and configurable levels.

**WiFi Provisioning**: Platform-specific implementations for:
- Linux: NetworkManager/nmcli
- macOS: CoreWLAN/networksetup
- Windows: netsh/PowerShell

### Platform Considerations
WiFi provisioning requires platform-specific network interface control:
- Linux: NetworkManager/wpa_supplicant
- macOS: CoreWLAN framework
- Windows: Windows.Devices.WiFi API

## Important Context

This is a Shelly smart home device manager designed for:
1. Discovering Shelly devices on the network
2. Provisioning unconfigured devices via their AP mode
3. Managing DHCP reservations for stable IP assignments
4. Integration with OPNSense firewall

The application has been fully refactored with comprehensive architecture and real implementations. All major components have unit tests and integration tests.
