### üìã Migration Guide

#### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Backup Current System**: Create complete backup before upgrading
   ```bash
   tar -czf shelly-manager-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz \
     /var/lib/shelly/ /etc/shelly/ /var/log/shelly/
   ```

2. **Generate Admin API Key**: Create secure admin API key for new features
   ```bash
   openssl rand -hex 32 > /etc/shelly/admin-key.txt
   chmod 600 /etc/shelly/admin-key.txt
   ```

3. **Update Configuration**: Add new configuration sections
   ```yaml
   security:
     admin_api_key_file: "/etc/shelly/admin-key.txt"
   export:
     output_directory: "/var/exports/shelly-manager"
   import:
     temp_directory: "/var/imports/shelly-manager"
   ```

4. **Create Required Directories**: Set up export/import directories
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /var/exports/shelly-manager /var/imports/shelly-manager
   sudo chown shelly-manager:shelly-manager /var/exports/shelly-manager
   sudo chown shelly-manager:shelly-manager /var/imports/shelly-manager
   ```

#### Compatibility Notes
- **Legacy Endpoints**: Old export endpoints remain functional but deprecated

  - Env/file overrides for SMTP password, OPNSense API key/secret, admin key, and provisioner API key.
  - Docs: `docs/SECURITY_SECRETS.md` expanded with Compose/K8s and `*_FILE` examples; `.env.example` updated; Compose examples annotated.
- Admin key rotation endpoint:
  - `POST /api/v1/admin/rotate-admin-key` (guarded by current admin key) rotates in-memory key across API/WS/export/import handlers; logs audit event.
