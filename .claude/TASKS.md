## 🚫 Not Planned / Out of Scope

### Features Explicitly Not Planned
- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Current design is single-tenant focused
- **Real-time Streaming**: Current polling-based approach is sufficient
- **Mobile Native Apps**: Web-based UI covers mobile use cases
- **Blockchain Integration**: No identified use case for this project
- **AI/ML Features**: Outside project scope and requirements

### Third-Party Integrations Not Prioritized
- **Amazon Alexa/Google Assistant**: Limited value for infrastructure management
- **Social Media Integration**: Not relevant for device management
- **Payment Processing**: Not applicable to this use case
- **Email Marketing**: Outside project scope
