# Shelly Manager Project Memory

## Project Overview
- **Type**: Shelly smart home device manager
- **Language**: Go 1.21
- **Module**: github.com/ginsys/shelly-manager
- **Stage**: Active development - Phase 1 implementation

## Documentation Reorganization (2025-08-11)
- Moved Claude-specific docs to `.claude/` directory
- Created `.claude/development-tasks.md` for task tracking
- Created `.claude/web-ui-requirements.md` for UI requirements
- Created `docs/ROADMAP.md` for user-facing roadmap
- Moved `TESTING.md` to `docs/` directory
- Updated all document references in CLAUDE.md and README.md

## Current Development Status (2025-08-10)

### âœ… Completed Tasks (4/13 Phase 1 tasks)
1. **Gen1 API Implementation** - COMPLETE
   - All /settings, /status, /control endpoints implemented
   - Advanced relay settings, dimmer control, RGBW control
   - Input configuration, LED control, schedule management
   - CoIoT and MQTT settings
   - Power monitoring for 1PM devices

2. **Gen2+ RPC Implementation** - COMPLETE
   - Full JSON-RPC protocol implementation
   - Proper digest authentication (RFC 2617)
   - All device-specific RPC methods (100+ methods)
   - Cover/Roller, Light, RGBW, Input management
   - System, Ethernet, Script, Webhook support
   - Energy meter, Bluetooth, Cloud, MQTT configuration

3. **Authentication Handling** - COMPLETE
   - Basic auth for Gen1 devices
   - Digest auth for Gen2+ devices
   - Proper challenge-response implementation

4. **Error Recovery & Retry Logic** - COMPLETE
   - Configurable retry attempts and delays
   - Proper error wrapping and context
   - Connection testing with auth detection

### ðŸ”„ Pending Tasks (9/13 remaining)
- Task 3: Capability-based configuration (type-safe structs)
- Task 4: Per-device configuration management
- Task 5: Import device config from physical devices
- Task 6: Export device config to physical devices
- Task 7: Configuration drift detection
- Task 8: Bulk configuration sync operations
- Task 10: Real-time status polling
- Task 11: Firmware version tracking
- Task 13: Real device testing suite

## Technical Decisions & Solutions

### Import Cycle Resolution
- **Problem**: Circular dependency between shelly, gen1, and gen2 packages
- **Solution**: Factory pattern returns error, services use DetectGeneration then create clients directly
- **Files affected**: factory.go, removed wrapper files

### Authentication Implementation
- **Gen1**: Basic HTTP authentication via SetBasicAuth
- **Gen2+**: Full digest authentication (RFC 2617) in digest_auth.go
- **Location**: internal/shelly/gen2/digest_auth.go

### Interface Design
- **Main Client Interface**: internal/shelly/client.go
- Extended with roller shutter operations
- Added advanced settings methods
- RGBW operations included
- Both Gen1 and Gen2 clients fully implement the interface

## File Structure Updates
```
internal/shelly/
â”œâ”€â”€ client.go           # Main Client interface (updated)
â”œâ”€â”€ factory.go          # Factory for device detection
â”œâ”€â”€ gen1/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ client.go       # Gen1 implementation (extended)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ roller.go       # Roller shutter operations
â”œâ”€â”€ gen2/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ client.go       # Gen2 implementation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ digest_auth.go  # NEW: Digest auth implementation
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ extended_methods.go # NEW: All RPC methods
```

## Key Implementation Details

### Gen1 Client
- Location: internal/shelly/gen1/client.go
- ~30 new methods added for complete device control
- Supports all Gen1 device types
- Retry logic with configurable attempts

### Gen2+ Client  
- Location: internal/shelly/gen2/client.go
- Digest authentication implemented
- 100+ RPC methods in extended_methods.go
- Full coverage of Pro, Plus, and specialized devices
- Component-based architecture support

## Next Priority
**Task 3**: Implement capability-based configuration
- Replace json.RawMessage with type-safe structs
- Use composition pattern from docs/DEVICE_CONFIGURATION_ARCHITECTURE.md
- Create capability interfaces and device-specific compositions

## Testing Status
- Unit tests exist but need updates for new methods
- Integration tests pending (Task 13)
- Manual testing required with real devices

## Build Status
- âœ… Project builds successfully
- âœ… No import cycles
- âœ… All packages compile independently

## Dependencies
No new dependencies added. Using standard library for:
- crypto/md5 for digest auth
- net/http for HTTP client
- encoding/json for JSON handling

## Notes for Future Development
1. Factory pattern limitation documented - services must detect and create directly
2. Digest auth implementation is RFC 2617 compliant
3. Gen2+ extended methods cover all documented device capabilities
4. Ready for capability-based configuration implementation (next task)
