# Shelly Manager - SuperClaude Project Memory

## Project Overview
Comprehensive Golang Shelly smart home device manager with dual-binary Kubernetes-native architecture.

**Repository Scale**: 165 Go files, 77,770 lines of code, 31 packages, 19 internal modules  
**Current Version**: v0.5.5-alpha - Production-ready with WebSocket metrics, E2E testing, enhanced UX

## ✅ Current Status - Strategic Modernization Phase

**Foundation Complete**: Production-ready dual-binary architecture with comprehensive backend functionality

**Critical Assessment**:
- ✅ **Backend Investment**: 138 API endpoints across 6 handler modules, 19 internal packages
- ⚠️ **Frontend Progress**: ~17% of backend API endpoints exposed (23/138) - see [Frontend Review](../docs/frontend/frontend-review.md)
- ✅ **Metrics System**: Real-time WebSocket metrics with a contract-enforced Go/TS message protocol, a freshness watchdog (truthful "LIVE"), and REST fallback (#247)
- ✅ **Export/Import**: Enhanced preview forms with schema-driven UX (100% API coverage)
- ✅ **Strict SMA/Previews**: Registry-backed previews and closed SMA `2026.1`
  with RFC 8785 integrity, bounded import normalization, and atomic generation
- ✅ **TypeScript**: Raw `vue-tsc` passes with a zero-error ratchet
- ⚠️ **Remaining Systems**: Notification (0%), Device Config (0%), Provisioning (0%), Drift Detection (0%)
- ✅ **Technical Debt Reduction**: Enhanced components eliminate major duplication patterns

**Security & Testing Achievement**:
- ✅ **Phase 6.9.2 COMPLETED**: Critical security vulnerabilities resolved
- ✅ **Database Coverage**: 82.8% (29/31 methods tested, 671-line test suite)
- ✅ **Plugin Coverage**: 63.3% (up from 0%)
- ✅ **Security Fixes**: Rate limiting bypass, context propagation, hostname sanitization
- ✅ **Test Infrastructure**: Comprehensive isolation framework operational
- ✅ **E2E Testing**: Complete Playwright infrastructure with 195+ scenarios across 5 browsers
- ✅ **E2E Optimization**: Development config achieved 99.1% performance improvement (23.5s vs 45+ min)
- ✅ **UI Testing**: WebSocket state management with 16 comprehensive unit tests

## 🎯 Active Development Plan

### Phase 6.9: Security & Testing Foundation ⚡ **COMPLETED**
- ✅ **Task 6.9.2**: Testing Strategy COMPLETED - All security vulnerabilities resolved
- ✅ **Task 6.9.4**: E2E Testing Infrastructure COMPLETED - Comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ **Task 6.9.5**: Metrics WebSocket Integration COMPLETED - Real-time functionality
- ⚠️ **Task 6.9.1**: Authentication & Authorization Strategy (DEFERRED to Phase 7)
- ⚠️ **Task 6.9.3**: Resource & Implementation Planning (DEFERRED to Phase 7)

### Phase 7: Backend-Frontend Integration ⚡ **READY TO BEGIN**
**Business Impact**: Transform to comprehensive infrastructure platform

See [Frontend Review](../docs/frontend/frontend-review.md) for detailed gap analysis, task list, and implementation order.

### Phase 8: Vue.js Frontend Modernization ⚡ **STRATEGIC PRIORITY**
**Technical Impact**: 9,400+ → ~3,500 lines (63% reduction), <5% code duplication  
**Performance**: <2s load, <500KB bundle, 90+ Lighthouse, WCAG 2.1 AA

## 🏗️ Architecture Status

**Infrastructure Complete**:
- ✅ Dual-binary: API server (containerized) + provisioning agent (host-based)
- ✅ Database: Multi-provider (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL) with 13 provider files
- ✅ Plugin System: 19 files supporting sync, notification, discovery
- ✅ Security: Comprehensive framework with vulnerability resolution
- ✅ Testing: 69 Go test files + comprehensive E2E infrastructure (195+ scenarios)
- ✅ API: 112+ endpoints with standardized security responses
- ✅ Real-time Features: WebSocket metrics with automatic failover to REST polling
- ✅ Enhanced UX: Schema-driven forms with real-time validation and preview

**Key Architecture Files**:

```

## 🛠️ Development Standards

**Testing**: Always run `make test-ci` before commits (matches GitHub Actions exactly)
**Quality**: Run `make fix` to format code and auto-fix lint issues
**Architecture**: Maintain dual-binary separation, structured logging, comprehensive error handling

**Go Version Management**:
- `.go-version` is the single source of truth for Go version
- Run `make check-go-version` to validate consistency across all files
- Run `make upgrade-go-version VERSION=X.Y.Z` to upgrade Go version everywhere
- CI validates Go version consistency before running tests

## 📋 Task Management

Project tracking is managed via **GitHub Issues**, **Milestones**, and **Project board**.

- Open issues represent active work items with labels for priority and area
- Milestones group issues by development phase (Phase 7, Phase 8)
- Historical tasks are preserved as closed issues for reference
- Development follows a feature branch workflow — see `CONTRIBUTING.md`

## 🎯 Success Metrics & Targets

### Phase 7 Targets
See [Frontend Review](../docs/frontend/frontend-review.md) Section 7 for detailed targets and success metrics.

### Phase 8 Targets  
- **Code Reduction**: 9,400+ → ~3,500 lines (63% reduction)
- **Performance**: <2s load, <500KB bundle, 90+ Lighthouse
- **Duplication**: 70% → <5% elimination

### Resource Allocation
- **Phase 7**: Backend Specialist + Full-stack Developer
- **Phase 8**: Frontend Specialist + Full-stack Developer + QA

## Quick Reference

**Current Priority**: Phase 7 - Device Management API integration and frontend feature expansion  
**Next Milestone**: Phase 7.2 - Notification system integration  
**Success Gate**: Authentication framework design (deferred but ready when needed)  
**Risk Mitigation**: Comprehensive E2E testing, WebSocket reliability, rollback procedures

**Recent Achievements**:
- ✅ **WebSocket Metrics**: Real-time dashboards with automatic failover
- ✅ **E2E Testing**: Production-ready test infrastructure across 5 browsers
- ✅ **Enhanced UX**: Schema-driven forms eliminate major usability barriers
- ✅ **Export Scope**: Inert export scheduling removed; drift, notification,
  and device/relay schedules remain separate
- ✅ **Technical Debt**: Significant reduction in component duplication
- ✅ **Frontend Review**: Comprehensive API gap analysis documented
