# Development Context & Conversation History

## Original Requirements

The user requested a Golang application for managing Shelly smart home devices with specific requirements:

### Core Features Requested
1. **Headless container operation** with CLI interface
2. **SQLite database** for device persistence  
3. **Configuration file support** (YAML)
4. **API server mode** with web frontend
5. **WiFi provisioning** for unconfigured devices
6. **DHCP reservation management** for OPNSense integration

## Key Technical Decisions

### Device Discovery Methods
- **HTTP Scanning**: Primary method for finding Shelly devices
- **mDNS Discovery**: For advertised devices
- **SSDP/UPnP Discovery**: For modern devices

### WiFi Provisioning Workflow
1. Scan for Shelly AP networks (e.g., "shelly1-XXXXXX")
2. Connect to device AP (192.168.33.1)
3. Configure production WiFi credentials via HTTP API
4. Device reboots and joins production network
5. Extract MAC address and hostname for DHCP

### DHCP Integration Process
1. Extract device MAC addresses post-provisioning
2. Generate standardized hostnames
3. Assign IPs from configured pool
4. Export reservations for OPNSense
5. Optional: Auto-sync via OPNSense API

### Architecture Patterns
- **CLI-first design** with web interface parity
- **Configuration-driven** behavior
- **Platform abstraction** for WiFi operations
- **Inter-application communication** for distributed systems

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Features
- Complete Go application with CLI and API
- SQLite database with GORM
- Web interface with modern UI
- Mock device discovery and management
- Configuration management system
- Docker containerization
- API endpoints for all major operations

### ðŸš§ Framework Ready (Needs Implementation)
- Real Shelly API communication
- WiFi provisioning system (Linux/macOS/Windows)
- DHCP reservation automation
- OPNSense API integration
- Network interface control

### ðŸ“‹ Architectural Foundations
- Proper project structure defined
- Configuration system implemented
- Database schema designed
- API endpoints specified
- Container deployment configured

## Next Development Phase

The project is optimized for continued development with Claude Code:

1. **Immediate**: Refactor monolithic code into packages
2. **Short-term**: Implement real Shelly device communication
3. **Medium-term**: Complete WiFi provisioning system
4. **Long-term**: Production hardening and advanced features

## Technical Notes

- All mock implementations are clearly marked for replacement
- Configuration supports all planned features
- Database schema accommodates full feature set
- API design supports both current and future functionality
- Container setup includes provisions for privileged networking
