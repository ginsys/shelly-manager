# Shelly Manager Roadmap

## Project Overview
Shelly Manager is a comprehensive Golang application for managing Shelly smart home devices, designed for deployment in Kubernetes with support for 20-100+ devices.

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ **Infrastructure Complete**: API server, database, web UI, Docker support
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Core Functionality In Progress**: Shelly device communication (~40% complete)
- üìã **Architecture Designed**: Configuration management system planned

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Device Management (In Progress)
Complete implementation of Shelly device communication and management
- Full Gen1 and Gen2+ API support
- Type-safe configuration management
- Device authentication and status polling
- Configuration import/export capabilities
- Drift detection and bulk operations

### Phase 2: Dual-Binary Architecture
Separate provisioning agent for WiFi operations
- Dedicated provisioner binary for network operations
- Task queue and agent registration system
- API communication between components

### Phase 3: WiFi Provisioning
Automated device provisioning workflow
- Shelly AP mode detection and connection
- WiFi credential configuration
- Network verification and rollback capabilities

### Phase 4: Kubernetes Deployment
Production-ready container deployment
- Optimized Docker images

## Timeline Estimates
- **Phase 1**: 2-4 weeks (critical path)
- **Phases 2-4**: 3-4 weeks combined
- **Phases 5-6**: 2 weeks
- **Phases 7-8**: 3-5 weeks

## Scaling Considerations

### Current Target (20-100 devices)
