## Technical Challenges Resolved

### 1. Import Cycle Issues
**Problem**: Test files importing `testutil` package created circular dependencies  
**Solution**: Created local test helper functions in each package's `testhelpers_test.go`

**Example Helper Function**:
```go
func assertEqual[T comparable](t *testing.T, expected, actual T) {
    t.Helper()
    if expected != actual {
        t.Fatalf("Expected %v, got %v", expected, actual)
    }
}
```

### 2. Mock Server Implementation
**Problem**: Need realistic device responses for integration testing  
**Solution**: Comprehensive mock HTTP servers simulating actual Shelly devices

**Gen2+ RPC Mock Server Example**:
```go
func createMockGen2Server() *httptest.Server {
    mux := http.NewServeMux()
    mux.HandleFunc("/rpc/Shelly.GetDeviceInfo", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        response := map[string]interface{}{
            "id":   1,
            "src":  "device-info",
            "result": map[string]interface{}{
                "name": "Test Device",
                "id":   "test-device-123",
                "gen":  2,
            },
        }
        json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(response)
    })
    return httptest.NewServer(mux)
}
```

### 3. Struct Field Mapping
**Problem**: Test code used incorrect field names not matching actual structs  
**Solution**: Systematic validation of all struct field names against actual definitions

**Fixes Applied**:
- `Input` field → `State` in InputStatus
- `Position` field → `CurrentPosition` in RollerStatus  
- Removed non-existent database.Device fields (Generation, Auth, Username, Password)
- Corrected DeviceConfig structure usage (no Name field, stores JSON config)

### 4. Function Signature Corrections
**Problem**: Test code used wrong function signatures  
**Solution**: Updated all function calls to match actual implementations

**Database Function Correction**:
```go
// Wrong:
err = manager.UpsertDeviceFromDiscovery(deviceInfo)

// Correct:
device, err := manager.UpsertDeviceFromDiscovery(mac, update, initialName)
```

### 5. Test Timeout Management
**Problem**: Network operations causing test timeouts  
**Solution**: Added short mode checks and timeout controls

```go
if testing.Short() {
    t.Skip("Skipping network operations in short mode")
}
```
